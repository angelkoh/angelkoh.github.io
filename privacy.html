    <h3> What information does my Applications obtain and how is it used?</h3>
    <p>
        All my free apps uses Google Admob and/or Mopub ("Ad Providers") to serve advertisements.
        The Ad Providers uses the coarse gsonLocation/country from your device to serve you regional
        advertisements. Naturally, the privacy policies of the Ad Providers applies to my apps
        too.</p>
