        This privacy policy governs your use of the software application for all apps that was
        created by me ("Angel Koh").</p>

    <h3> What information does my Applications obtain and how is it used?</h3>

        <br>
        <li>Collects Android advertising (ad) ID, app set ID, and, if applicable, other identifiers related to signed-in accounts on the device.</li>

    </ul>
