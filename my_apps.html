            <h5>ðŸ‘¾Companion Android Apps to <span>Desktop Games</span>ðŸ‘¾</h5>
            Android apps to compliment some old games I play. Removes the need to remember all the heroes' names and
            their
            stats. A good quality of life addition when playing the game
            <p>
                These are mainly <i>"query and lookup"</i> apps to see if heroes are worth taking a trip to the
                market to recruit, or if a curio should be cleansed, etc.
            </p>

            <p>And of course, here's the disclaimer: These apps are not endorsed by, authorized, nor sponsored by the
                game companies. <br>Feel free to use them for your personal gaming, but do not sell them for
                profit.

            <h5>â˜¯Oracles and Fortune-telling Android Appsâ˜¯</h5>

            <p>
                These are mainly <i>"Occult and divining"</i> apps I create for fortune-telling. Do note that these apps are only for entertainment, and shouldn't be treated as anything other than that.
                <br></br><b>NOTE:</b> Please do not make life-changing decisions just because a random app says that the
                stars are aligned in your favor!

                        YA Tarot contains the readings for all the cards in the deck, as well as a simple fortune-teller
                        using the Celtic Method of Divination.

                        This app is based on the Rider-Waite-Smith deck (1909) and the Pictorial Key to the Tarot
                        (1911). All of which are in the public domain today.
